Manual Currency Exchange Program by me

# How it works?
Well,We are defining currencies with double data type.And We are creating if methods to use our application.I added 13 currencies(euro, dollar, gbpound, rusruble, swedishkrone, danishkrone, bulgarianlev, canadiandollar, chineseyen, japaneseyen, norwegiankorune, czechkorune, manat(Azerbaijan Currency AZN)) and for calculating it we are using simple formula  <strong>"Currency = Amount * Price".</strong> 
 For example:

  in that code we are converting 1 euro to other currencies.
  
  <p><strong>DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("##.##");</strong></p> 
  
  when are printing,we are using this subclass for formatting Decimal Numbers.
  
# Why is called Manual Currency Exchange?
Because we are defining prices manually,and we are not using special frameworks to get data from server.
