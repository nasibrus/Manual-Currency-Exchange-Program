# Manual-Currency-Exchange-Program
Manual Currency Exchange Program by me

# How it works?
Well,We are defining currencies with double data type.And We are creating if methods to use our application.I added 13 currencies(euro, dollar, gbpound, rusruble, swedishkrone, danishkrone, bulgarianlev, canadiandollar, chineseyen, japaneseyen, norwegiankorune, czechkorune, manat(Azerbaijan Currency AZN)) and for calculating it we are using simple formula "Currency = Amount * Price". 
 For example:

  in that code we are converting 1 euro to dollar.
  
# Why is called Manual Currency Exchange?
Because we are defining prices manually
